# Programming Style Guide
> Consistency is key - Jack Schwarz (6-15-20)

#### All code written should adhere to the following styling guidelines


## Variable Naming

* All variable names must follow the following conventions
`first_second` NOT `firstSecond`

* JSON data folows the same conventions
##### Ex: `word_another: 'Two Words'`


* All final variables and auth codes should be Uppercase (obviously)

## Commenting

* All functions have to have params detailed and a short descriptor on what it does

## General/Misc.

* Try to avoid long variable names and long function names, keep it simple
